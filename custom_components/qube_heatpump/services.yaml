      example: "1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef"
write_register:
  name: Write holding register
  description: >
    Write a value to a Modbus holding register exposed by the Qube heat pump.

    Home Assistant's native modbus.write_register service.
  fields:
    address:
      name: Register address
      description: >

    value:
      name: Value

      required: true
      example: 55.0
    data_type:
      name: Data type
      description: >
        Register data type. Use float32 for 32-bit floating point registers.
